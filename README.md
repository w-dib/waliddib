## Hey, I'm Walid ðŸ‘‹

I'm the founder of Callmi, a platform that lets you book MENA's most in-demand startup experts over a 1:1 video call. I previously founded two other startups: a blockchain B2B InsurTech called Addenda, and a B2C InsurTech called Hala Insurance. I spend my free time learning to how code video games for fun using Godot, an open-source engine.
